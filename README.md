## Description
This project involves a graphical user interface (GUI) for analyzing honeycomb cell distances in the context of honey bee breeding. The GUI is developed using Python's Tkinter library, providing an intuitive way to 
calculate and visualize shortest paths between labeled cells on a honeycomb structure. The program includes features such as input validation, distance calculation, path tracing, and GUI components for user-friendly interaction. 

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Honey-bee-breeding`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## To View the GUI
1. Run the program: `python bee_breeding.py`
2. Make sure that all the required dependencies are in the same folder as your bee_breeding.py file.
3. The GUI window will appear, allowing you to interact with the Honey Bee Breeding tool.


Feel free to explore and utilize this GUI to gain insights into honeycomb cell distances and bee breeding patterns.
